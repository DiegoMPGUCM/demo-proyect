# Data Project Template
This project template is made available as a GitHub template.

## Adjusting .gitignore

Ensure you adjust the `.gitignore` file according to your project needs. For example, since this is a template, the `/data/` folder is commented out and data will not be exlucded from source control:

```plaintext
# exclude data from source control by default
# /data/
```

Typically, you want to exclude this folder if it contains either sensitive data that you do not want to add to version control or large files.
